terraform Is an declartive approache to provsion resources in cloud 
Current we are going through AWS cloud as our resource

After declareing Provider navigate to spefuc path over commad prompt and 
    1. Execute: 'terraform init' where our terraform file exist 
    2. declare the resource which we want to provision and every resource will have prefix of their provider 
    3. After that as we are using aws provider create an I am user with admin crreditials take the scretId and password 
    4. by using Set ACCESS_ID=value and ACESS_Password=value user Keys what ever you download key file
    5. After that try these:
                terraform plan-> which will give what will  happen if current terraform script executed
                terraform apply -> what ever we specfied in terraform it will applied to resources whaich are present in providers place
    6. How Terraform Internalluy works:
                when ever we make changes to terraform file it first check what are the desired state of our resources and 
                what are current state of our resources if desired state is different than current state then will perform it's desired state
    7. to navigate into terraform consloe 'terraform console'  -> we resources name and play with it
    8. output inside terraform file:

    9.terraform apply -refresh=false (to avoid refresh and current state from provider)

    10. save the terrform plan and execute the plan
