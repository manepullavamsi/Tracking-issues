Title: Fixing the "Failed to Configure a DataSource" Error in Spring Boot

[] [reference](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-failed-to-configure-data-source)

Introduction:
The "Failed to configure a DataSource" error can occur when working with a Spring Boot project that includes the spring-data-starter-jpa dependency and a MySQL JDBC driver. This tutorial will guide you through resolving this error using two different approaches. You can either define the data source or disable the auto-configuration of the data source.

## 1. Overview<a name="overview"></a>
In this tutorial, we will discuss the "Failed to configure a DataSource" error that occurs in a Spring Boot project. We will explore the causes of this error and provide solutions to resolve it.

## 2. The Problem<a name="the-problem"></a>
When running a Spring Boot application with the spring-data-starter-jpa dependency and a MySQL JDBC driver, the application fails with a "Failed to configure a DataSource" error. This section describes the error and its manifestation.

## 3. The Cause<a name="the-cause"></a>
The "Failed to configure a DataSource" error occurs because Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism attempts to configure a JPA DataSource automatically. However, the necessary JDBC connection properties are not provided, leading to the error. This section explains the cause in more detail.

## 4. Resolving the Error<a name="resolving-the-error"></a>
To resolve the "Failed to configure a DataSource" error, we have three options. This section presents the solutions with code examples.

### 4.1. Define the DataSource Using Properties<a name="define-the-datasource-using-properties"></a>
By providing the required data source properties in the application.properties or application.yml file, we can solve the issue. This subsection demonstrates how to define the data source properties using both file formats.

### 4.2. Define the DataSource Programmatically<a name="define-the-datasource-programmatically"></a>
Another approach is to programmatically define the data source using the DataSourceBuilder class. This subsection illustrates how to create the data source bean using Java configuration.

### 4.3. Exclude DataSourceAutoConfiguration<a name="exclude-datasourceautoconfiguration"></a>
If you are not ready to define the data source or want to prevent Spring Boot from auto-configuring it, you can exclude the DataSourceAutoConfiguration class. This subsection explains three methods to exclude the auto-configuration using properties and annotations.

## 5. Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>
In conclusion, this tutorial provided an overview of the "Failed to configure a DataSource" error in Spring Boot projects. We explored the causes of the error and presented three solutions to resolve it. By defining the data source or disabling the auto-configuration, you can overcome this issue. The accompanying GitHub repository contains the complete code used in this tutorial.

Remember to adapt the code examples to your specific project requirements and configurations.
